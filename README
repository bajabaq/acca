The altitude_info table is missing data for air density (lbpercf)
at altitudes 4000, 5000, 10000, 12000
these values can be interpolated or extrapolated, however it seems prudent to tabulate these values

Also 
minimum elevation is     0 ft
maximum elevation is 12000 ft

Since this program is for US / North America, max and minimum elevations are:
20310 ft (Denali, Alaska) and -279 ft (Badwater Basin - Death Valley, California)

While the appropriate values for these locations can be extrapolated, it seems prudent to explicitly extend the tabulated values
to encompass these extremes

Also, it may be a good idea to extend to Earth extremes (although I understand highest city is 12313 ft (Badrinath, India)
29029 ft (Mt Everest) and lowest point is -1404 ft (Dead Sea, Israel)
